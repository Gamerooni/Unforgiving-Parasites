# Unforgiving-Parasites
Unforgiving Devices rework of Sexlab Parasites.

This is just my attempt to experiment with UD's various features to see what's possible, and SL Parasites needed a conversion anyway.

## Rough Summary

Most parasites here come in one of two types:
 - Interactible (e.g. Spider Penis)
 - Static (e.g. Tentacle Armor)

Interactible parasites are those you can remove using UD minigames. They'll usually do their best to settle as deep within the character as possible - the more entrenched they are, the harder it'll be to remove them (very similar to Inflation Plugs in UD). The wearer's arousal also plays a massive role; a high enough arousal will make these impossible to extract.

It's very important to also consider that many of these interactible parasites will be near-impossible (but not entirely impossible! make sure to try them all out) to remove unless you know how to cure them. You'll find out how during the Parasites questline.

Finally, static parasites are just that - static. They're stuck on you forever, or until you find out how to cure them. It should be very clear to you if you're wearing one of these, since you simply won't have any way of escaping it.

## TO-DO

On the to-do:
 - ~~custom menus for the various plugs (they shouldn't say stuff like "Vibrate" or "Inflate")~~
- ~~Go over everything and ensure there are no auto-patched locks (there shouldn't be a padlock on a tentacle skinsuit)~~
  - sorta done - just need to make sure I don't forget to do this on every device
- ~~FaceHugger~~ and FaceHuggerGag
- ChaurusWorm and ChaurusWormVag
- The entire spriggan set
- ~~custom sounds for vibration events~~
  - ~~sorta done - just need to test~~
  - must normalise all the sounds to make sure it's all consistent
- ~~Change from accessibility to some other form of difficulty for the devices~~
- tons of testing to ensure the overall quest still works
- Automatic CI/CD
  - Trimmed READMEs, etc.
  - Spriggit <=> .esp (both ways - I make edits in both places)
  - scripts to .pex
  - build script to make it into FOMOD
    - with script sources and MO files as options
- Documentation about what this mod does somewhere (maybe as a nexus page or GH wiki?)
