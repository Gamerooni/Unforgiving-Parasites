# Unforgiving-Parasites
Unforgiving Devices rework of Sexlab Parasites.

This is just my attempt to experiment with UD's various features to see what's possible, and SL Parasites needed a conversion anyway.

On the to-do:
 - ~~custom menus for the various plugs (they shouldn't say stuff like "Vibrate" or "Inflate")~~
- ~~Go over everything and ensure there are no auto-patched locks (there shouldn't be a padlock on a tentacle skinsuit)~~
  - sorta done - just need to make sure I don't forget to do this on every device
- FaceHugger and FaceHuggerGag
- ChaurusWorm and ChaurusWormVag
- The entire spriggan set
- ~~custom sounds for vibration events~~
  - sorta done - just need to test
- Change from accessibility to some other form of difficulty for the devices
- tons of testing to ensure the overall quest still works
- Automatic CI/CD
  - Trimmed READMEs, etc.
  - Spriggit <=> .esp (both ways - I make edits in both places)
  - scripts to .pex
  - build script to make it into FOMOD
    - with script sources and MO files as options
- Documentation about what this mod does somewhere (maybe as a nexus page or GH wiki?)
