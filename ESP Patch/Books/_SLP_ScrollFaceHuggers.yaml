    <img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/G_letter.png'>ehenoth Broodling - this parasite is not a myth, but is probably extinct. A reference is included here for completeness sake. Originally found in the far northern part of Skyrim, the habits, reproduction, and attack of this parasite are today unknown. Almost all records of this parasite were lost when much of Dawnstar was destroyed during the Oblivion Crisis, including the Jarl's Court Wizard's house where he kept detailed notes. All that remains elsewhere are scattered fragments, that speak of "many tiny sharp teeth."


    Falmer parasites - while the Falmer are considered unsanitary and unsavory creatures, they are no more or less susceptible to parasites than other races. Despite their association with the Chaurus species, they are not specifically carriers of any known parasites. Their subterranean existence may have them come into contact with parasites not commonly found on the surface, but miners and adventurers that delve into such subterranean areas do not report any unusual parasites. To date there have been no verified reports of any specifically "Falmer" parasites. This includes the rumored "Chaurus Spine" parasite, that many say is given by Falmer shamans, though reports of this are also varied, with some individuals saying that the Chaurus Spine is instead a form of Chaurus Worm received from so-called "queen" Chaurus beasts. Nobody in any official capacity has ever seen one, and it is widely believed to be a hoax.
