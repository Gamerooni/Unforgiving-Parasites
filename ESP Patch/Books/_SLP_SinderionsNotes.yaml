    4E 58 Second Seed


    I thought I had mostly to worry about Dwarven automata guarding the Cathedral.. I was wrong. The Falmers present a much bigger threat. Even as they are completely blind, they seem to form a special bond with their chaurus pets... possibly even seeing through their eyes. 


    Crushing chaurus eggs with dirt and glowing mushroom seem to mask my presence well enough to move about freely as long as I am careful about the noise I produce.


    I managed to preserve a few specimens of crimson nirnroots but they seem incredibly fragile once they are extracted from their original environment.


    4E 58 Mid Year


    I suspect the key to the preservation of the nirnroots lies in the water of Blackreach itself... not in the mushrooms as I first suspected. There is definitely something in the water. After drinking it every day for the past few months, I can feel its effect on my metabolism. I am slowly losing muscle mass but my weight is preserved. I am certainly gaining more fat. 


    My search for more specimens has led me to observe the falmers a lot more closely lately. What odd creatures. Their features have converged to a androgenous figure. Males and females look extremely similar. They seem unable to procreate by themselves... I have not seen a single child... and yet their sex drive is incredibly high. The screams of the victims they abducted from the surface echo through the caves day and night.


    4E 58 Sun Height


    The falmers don't seem to have much of a hierarchy or society, except for their shamans. They are the most interested in interacting with the chaurus and tending to their eggs. The care they display for the chaurus borders on devotion.


    I observed the same degree of devotion to crimson nirnroots. That cannot be a coincidence.


    4E 58 Last Seed?


    I don't know how long I will be able to continue my research. Between the milky waters and the daily mixture I am applying to remain hidden from the falmers, the toll on my body has been high. My hair loss is now complete. My skin is now as pale as the falmers. My teeth are falling out. And more concerning of all, my chest and genitals have begun to change into female attributes!


    Last night was my most daring attempt at understanding more of the link between the falmers, blackreach waters and the crimson nirnroots. I broke into the tent of one of their shamans and left with a treasure trove of herbs, ointments and some peculiar items. Most intriguing of all is a star shaped stone. It seems made of a mix between stone and metal. The body of the stone shimers sometimes, and looks like a seed. 


    The falmers seemed agitated after I came back to safety. I can hear their cries. I hope I didn't cross a line.

    4E 200 - Annotations by Alicia DuSkrimall


    This wonderful research facility feels like an oasis in the middle of a merciless desert. 

    I have been able to regain my strength after months of captivity to the falmers. 

    A few more days and I will be able to try for the surface.


    Sleepless nights have their perks. I have taken over Sinderion's experiments of that mysterious Seed Stone.


    I am no closer to understanding its purpose, but I can say for certain it is highly reactive to the waters and to some extend, the spores in the air. Exposure to either make the stone shimmer, almost vibrate. I could swear I saw the patterns in the body of the stone shift.. almost as if something moved under the surface. But it is not translucent, and still looks and feels like stone.
