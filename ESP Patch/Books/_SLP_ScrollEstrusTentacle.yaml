    <img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/S_letter.png'>o-called "living armors" are types of exoparasites that are usually more benign, and in truth can often be considered symbiotic instead. Living Armor parasites do not usually attach themselves to the body, instead surviving quite comfortably on their own, and are often deliberately worn as clothing, providing a number of benefits to their host, such as protection (Living Armor parasites usually have thick, tough skins that made ideal light armor) or various magical attributes.

     There are exceptions, though - some forms of Living Armor are true parasites. Though they do not usually attach to a host of their own volition, these malignant ones, once worn, do not detach without great force, dexterity, or magical assistance.

    Some forms of both benign and malignant Living Armor parasites do not technically require sustenance from their hosts, but others do seem to require nutrients, most notably those types that feed on female lactation.


    Living Armors can be readily identified by their form - usually a tenticular body consisting of up to a dozen tendrils of varying sizes. Though tendrils do often extend into the body cavity through any opening, they are not considered endoparasites.


    Estrust Tentacles - Though there have been many reports of the so-called "Estrus Monster" attacking isolated females, no two reports are the same. The only thing common to all reports is that the monster is gelatinous, and capable of forming tentacles, pseudopods, and phallic objects. It is generally accepted among academicians that this is nothing more than the delusional creation of an overly sexually-aroused mind. The "ooze" parasite, said to cause mammary growth and lactation, is likewise a myth.


    This includes the rarely reported "cock tentacle" that is also undoubtedly nothing more than a hallucination or delusion created by a disturbed mind.


    Living Armor coloration is varied, and parasites can be bright red, black, green, yellow, or even in some cases translucent.

    Estrus Ooze - this fanciful creation of deranged minds does not exist. Though there have been many reports of the so-called "Estrus Monster" attacking isolated females, no two reports are the same. The only thing common to all reports is that the monster is gelatinous, and capable of forming tentacles, pseudopods, and phallic objects. It is generally accepted among academicians that this is nothing more than the delusional creation of an overly sexually-aroused mind. The "ooze" parasite, said to cause mammary growth and lactation, is likewise a myth.

    This includes the rarely reported "cock tentacle" that is also undoubtedly nothing more than a hallucination or delusion created by a disturbed brain.


    Mimic Bathing Drum - The term "mimic bathing drum" is widely disputed. Names for this creature range from "furo tentacle cask" to "tentacle bathing tub" to "mimic bathtub" and other variants.


    This creature is included here for completeness sake, but is not actually a parasite at all. It exhibits some parasitic traits, but it does not seem to require a host. The Mimic Bathing Drum lies in wait for an unwary adventurer to step too close, often mimicking a natural wading pool (rumors that it mimics actual constructed bathtubs are patently false). When the unfortunate subject comes within range, the creature reaches out with anywhere from a few to several dozen tentacular appendages, sucking the prey in. 


    Reports differ as to whether the prey is altered or implanted with some egg, larva, or other reproductive function are unclear. What is known that all prey is eventually expelled from the creature, none the worse for wear except for a lack of clothing and armor, which is removed. Individuals thus trapped report an alarming degree of sexual stimulation, although this is likely a falsehood perpetuated by the sexually unrestrained and is not to be taken seriously. It is unknown what the creature subsists on, as all ensnared individuals report no long-term harm.
