    <b>Experiment log - 4E 198</b><br>

    Another failed experiment. The specimens are growing restless. Could it be they are sensing the death of my previous subjects?

    <br>(...)

    Specimen 305 survived the injection! Its bristles are glowing and infused with magicka. I can't wait to dissect it and study the changes to its venom and silk.

    <br>(...)

    By the Gods, how did I get so careless! I underestimated the resistance to sedation and specimen 315 assaulted me right there in its cage. Fortunately, the door was shut or I would have an infestation problem. She didn't kill me (obviously) but she spent what felt like an eternity pump my guts full of eggs. I have never felt so sore and weak in my life. 

    <br>(...)

    Those eggs are growing I swear. I feel them roll in my bowels with every step. The pressure is driving me crazy. 

    <br>(...)

    The eggs have a laxative effect. it is possible they even absorb waste for their own support, leaving behind only dirty fluids. 

    <br>(...)

    I tried everything I could to extract them out of me. This isn't something I can do by myself. Dwemer oil seems to help, and even then, all I could manage is to expel one of the eggs. The rest seems clumped together in a viscous matrix.

    <br>(...)

    The eggs seem to have a calming effect on the other specimens. I have made more progress these last few days than over the past months. I swear I could bludgeon one of the spiders to death and it wouldn't do anything to endanger the eggs inside of me.

    <br>(...)

    More than a month with these eggs inside me now. I have to say they are starting to feel almost enjoyable. I have even traced their calming effect to a pheromone in my sweat. I guess the eggs are changing my own metabolism somehow.

    <br>(...)

    My fears of the eggs growing inside me were unfounded. It has been two months now, and there is no visible change in volume inside me. My stomach still bulges a little. My hunger has decreased and my stools are still liquid. I have managed to synthesize the pheromone. That should come in handy for future experiments.

    <br>(...)

    Those cursed eggs will be the death of me. I am having nightly dreams of the spider on top of me, pounding me and filling me with eggs. Efforts to relieve myself have been futile. I am so damn horny all the time. Is this another side effect of the pheromone? 

    <br>(...)

    I broke down last night. I am ashamed to say I went to the cages, stripped down and let the spiders mount me. It was worse than my dreams. It felt glorious. And to my great surprise, the spider pulled the eggs out of me on its own. They were hanging in small sacks under her abdomen when he was done with me. Is that how they mate I wonder? The female deposits eggs in a host and a male extracts and fertilizes them?

    <br>(...)

    What have I done? the eggs left a void inside me... and unspeakable cravings. I will make another batch of pheromones tonight and mate with the new female I just acquired. Time to change the focus of my experiments.

    <br>
