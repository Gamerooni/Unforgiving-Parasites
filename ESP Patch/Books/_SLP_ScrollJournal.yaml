    I must begin this missive by stating that I still firmly believe that the so-called Chaurus Worm is a benign parasite. However, my previous assertion that the Chaurus Worm is unrelated to the evil arthropod hybrid known as "Chaurus" must, unfortunately, be revised.

    I was once a Master Physician in the service of the High King of Skyrim, but no longer. Two years ago, I finished writing a series of books on the parasites of Skyrim, considered to be the foremost resource on the subject, but rather than rest on my laurels, I decided to research more. In my zeal to study the parasites of Skyrim, I have inadvertently become infected with one such, although "infected" is a poor word to describe the process by which I was parasitized.

    I can confirm that Chaurus Worms are, in fact, "laid" into their hosts by the parent Chaurus, and that the process is vile in the extreme. Whether these worms are only laid in female hosts or whether it was simply my bad fortune, I cannot speak to. I can, and must, state to any would-be adventurers that just because you have killed all of the Chaurus in front of you does not mean that there is not also one behind you. Be wary when entering Falmer dens!

    In contradiction to all known evidence, the Chaurus Worm is not laid into the vaginal canal of the victim, instead it is laid in the anus. Previous reports must have been incorrect. Either that, or this particular Chaurus was simply a stupid example of the species and missed its mark.

    Due to my unfortunate condition, I have elected to remain in the tunnels. It has been several days now since I have been infected, and this provides an excellent way to study the parasite in question firsthand. I will continue to post entries in this journal as the parsite progresses, keeping track of all relevant data. Although this is a digsusting and vile thing, I believe that I can maintain my professional and clinical detachment throughout the process.

    The worm continues to move about on its own. The sexual stimulation is somewhat distracting, but nothing I cannot overcome through sheer force of will. More problematic is the constant attacks by Chaurus and Falmer. Where do the beasts keep coming from? I have attempted to seal all of the entrances into the chamber, yet I continue to be assaulted. Although the corpses of the beasts provide fine test subjects, the smell of burnt flesh and charred carapace is somewhat nauseating.

    The worm appears to be leaking a luminescent fluid. I cannot determine what, if any, effect the fluid has though.

    Getting low on food. It turns out that the dead Chaurus beasts are nourishing, though the taste leaves something to be desired.

    The worm continues to wiggle. Its growth has stopped, but there is something else going on. I feel a tightness along my spine, on the skin, and I believe it may stem from the worm, though I cannot be certain. I cannot see the affected area, and what I can reach tells me nothing. I could wish for a mirror.

    Last week, an attack left me clothesless. I was assaulted by six Falmer in a tight group, and had to defend myself with a number of fireballs. My robes, and unfortunately most of the rest of my supplies, were burned to ash.

    The worm has grown an extention, and has invaded my sex. This may be the reported "vaginal" insertion of the worm, though previous statements of victims did not state that the worm grows in this way. Sexual stimulation has increased, and is getting somewhat harder to ignore, though I am still confident that I can maintain my composure.

    Oddly enough, yesterday when a Falmer invaded my home it did not seem hostile, but instead confused. I slaughtered the beast anyway, but perhaps the parasite is beginning to emit a pheromone or something that baffles the blind beasts.

    The skin infestation has spread around my flanks, and I can now examine it minutely. This does not appear to be an effect of the worm, though there may be some relation. More study is required. By the divines, I must stop fingering myself! Made more difficult now because the damnable thing has begun to expand inside the vaginal canal. And my clitoris is being constantly pinched!

    <font size='12'>No, I must be strong.<font size='16'>

    Far beneath the surface, under earth, under stone;

    Lies a portal made of souls, built of blood, built of bone;

    Through the portal dwelt a People, living lives, dark and grim;

    'Till a wizard, clumsy magus, cast a spell and summoned them;

    And the People lost their Queen, lost their hearts, lost their homes;

    Sent to here, this plane called Nirn, upon a mountain strewn with Bones;

    And the Queen, she writhes in pain, trapped between, tied with threads;

    Of the spirits of the doomed, of the damned, of the dead;

    And the Queen cannot become, cannot be free, cannot be born;

    For the Host is not yet ready; she must wait, alone, forlorn;

    So the People gird themselves, prepare the way, construct a hold;

    For the night when She will rise, to conquer all, and rule the world.

    Today a <font color='#5b150e'>Chaurus</font> brought me the corpse of a dead deer. Or maybe just brought the der to the room. I don't know. I think they're of the opinion that I may be one of them. Not sure. It seems reasonable, considering what has happened. I wasn't sure at first, because all I could feel was more weight on my back, but it appears as though I may have grown wings. At least, I think that's what they are. I can't really use them, though I believe I can contract some muscles I did not have before. But when I turn my head, there they are, wings.

    The skin <font size='17'>infection</font> has grown up over my neck. If this gets any hier I might have to do something drastic - I don't want to stop breathing because it covers my mouth. Damn worms!

    <font size='12'><font color='#4c1d0f'>Nice Chaurus.</font></font><font size='16'>

    I had an aksident yesterday when making some potions. Either my alchemy skill is suffering because of the constant stimulation, or I don't know what else worms. The worms. They emit a luminescent liquid... did I already say that? Focus.

    The Chaurus Worm emits a luminescent liquid that, when properly prepared and ingested, causes the skin to glow. I don't know what posessed me to consume the liquid, for I had no real knowledge of what it would do. I just felt compelled...

    On the plus side, the lacol mushrooms taste a litttle better now. I no longer feel slightly sick when eating them. Perhaps the liquid provides some measure of immunity to toxins?

    Another effect, and this one I'm not sure if it comes from the parasite or from the liquid, but I'm having some skin lesions. Little bumps and holes. Not like the other hole that the worm is in. Little holes.
