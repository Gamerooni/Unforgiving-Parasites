    <img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/T_letter.png'>he Frostbite Spider of northeastern High Rock and Skyrim is a patient ambush hunter, usually dwelling in caves or more rarely in treetops. These giant spiders reproduce in a similar fashion to their smaller cousins - by laying eggs in nests.


    However, they must be included in this tome due to their other method of reproduction. Much like the Chaurus, Frostbite Spiders are capable of reproducing in a modified obligate fashion. Though the exact origin of this ability is unknown - until the early Third Era, no mention of this is ever recorded - it is suspected that it has a magical cause. Frostbite Spiders make excellent magical test subjects due to their short lifespan, rapid reproduction, and hardiness. Many wizards test new spells on these giant arachnids before beginning experimentation on men and mer. The ethics of the practice are not a subject for debate here, but it is well known that Frostbite Spiders tend to take on the attributes of their experimentation. It is assumed that their bizarre method of alternate reproduction is one such case.


    Frostbite Spiders sometimes target females from men or mer sexually instead of violently, clasping the bodies in their legs and penetrating their vagina. No instances of oral or anal infection have ever been recorded. The spiders inject a number of eggs into the vaginal opening, often as deep as the womb, followed by a liquid wax that rapidly becomes a vitreous mucilage, semi-permanently bonding the eggs to the vaginal walls. The wax emits powerful pheromones that will make the host appear friendly to other spiders.


    The eggs will then be protected, warm, and well fed on sexual fluids. The eggs will remain in the host until forcibly removed or the host dies, and one elderly Dunmer woman reported eggs remaining in her for nearly eighty years.


    During their stay, they provide a great deal of sexual stimulation during anal sex, and seem to do absolutely no harm to the host except for some mild fever. In fact, many individuals so afflicted do not seek to remove the eggs, due to the sudden relief from dealing with alimentary functions, not to mention the aforementioned sexual stimulation.


    The cycle ends when another female spider finds the host and copulates with her. The secretions from the spider's vaginal appendages disolve the wax and collect the eggs, fertilizing them in the process. In a swift manoeuver, the spider binds the eggs into a large egg sack and leave the host as a useless husk.


    There have been reports of male spiders leaving their appendage burried inside the female womb as a way to keep her from reproducing with any other male. In such rare occurences, the male is said to follow the female around to protect her until the eggs are fertilized by a female spider.
