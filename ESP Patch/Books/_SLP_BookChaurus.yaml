    <img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/T_letter.png'>hose venturing in Skyrim's deepest underground reaches should be wary of the Chaurus, a giant insect that spits poison and bites with its razor-sharp mandibles.


    Ever since I reached the northern province of Skyrim to study the various unique fauna of the region, I have entertained a unique fascination for the chaurus species. At first glance, they are not unlike large insect species found throughout Tamriel, but they truly stand aside due to their unique biology and the special relationship with the feral falmer tribes found within the region's caves and Dwemer ruin networks. Chaurus may also be found alongside the western salt marshes of Hjaalmarch, as opposed to the mudcrabs or Frostbite Spiders that usually inhabit the area. The chaurus are used by the Falmer as both companions and cattle. When entering an underground or indoor area where live chaurus are present, their presence is indicated by a loud chittering noise.


    Chaurus are large, venomous insects that live deep in the lightless caverns and chasms beneath Skyrim. They have been domesticated by the Falmer, and often live and fight alongside their masters. They're domesticated insects, which really isn't unprecedented in Tamriel. We know the Dunmer do it, too, as did their Chimer ancestors. Different species of insects are used in Morrowind, but it's the same basic principle. Unlike other scholars before me, my extended stay in the depth of Blackreach convinced me the Falmer developed a symbiotic relationship with these giant bugs after being blinded and forced to live underground.


    There are four main varieties of chaurus.


    The standard for is as large as a dog and the most commonly domesticated by the falmer. As the chaurus gets older, it grows into the larger, more aggressive form - the reaper.


    Chaurus Reapers are much larger. Deep underground, in certain areas, chaurus reapers grow to be unusually large, sometimes as large as mammoths. These larger chaurus reapers are fast in movement but not very agile, yet still may be difficult to kill. 


    After a certain period of time in the chaurus' reaper stage, the creature will become sluggish and enter a comatose death like state (previous researchers have confused this for actual death.) It's body will become bloated and turn into a chrysalis where the the hunter will grow. The Chrysalis seems to be sensitive to nearby vibrations as the hunter has been known to stay in it's chrysalis waiting for a potential first prey to wander by before it will emerge, and some hunters (called fledglings) have been known to emerge to capture prey before they are fully matured.


    Chaurus Hunter Fledglings, and Chaurus Hunter are both flying forms of chauri. I also observed related species, such as shellbugs but it wasn't clear to me if they are to be considered as members of the chauri families.


    Just under the mandible joints of the chaurus are sacs of corrosive venom that can melt through iron with ease. The chaurus are able to spit this venom at distances of up to thirty feet to catch prey, which they usually hunt for at night, when they prowl outside of their caves, attacking any creatures they come across whether that be elk, wolves, bears, or even people. The venom also coats their mandibles, which allows them to easily tunnel through rock and stone. 


    Standard chauri are capable of breeding but chauri in their reaper form are known to be ravenous. I have observed both forms of chauri going to great lengths to mate not only with one another, but also with human and mer females.


    During breeding, a mated pair of chauri will burrow into a cave wall together where they will mate for up to two weeks after which they will leave the hole and the female will lay a large cluster of round blue eggs in communal caves covered with resinous bioluminescent fluids. The eggs will usually hatch after a few months. The young larvae are usually a couple of inches long, but will quickly grow to younger, larger nymphs which will continue to slowly grow to mature size over the course of their lifetime.


    Attempts at mating with human or mer females are usually short lived. Most specimens I had the occasion to observed died in agony while giving birth to piles of eggs, their belly and breasts inflated beyond recognition. Insemination by chaurus eggs seem to accelerate large production of lactation hormones as well as increase arousal. The changes in the female physiology are very quick and in rare cases where the female survived, larger breasts remained long after excetion of the eggs. 


    Human and mer females are, of course, not capable of taking chaurus eggs to term. Instead, they appear to act as receptacles for eggs until they grow too large for the host, at which point the eggs are violently excreted through the vagina of the female. Females with flexible anatomy, such as after childbirth, are more likely to survive the event.


    At first, I thought the obsession of the falmers to abduct human and mer females had something to do with their own reproduction cycle. It stood to reason that they needed fresh specimens to procreate with given the poisonous state of their bodies. But after living among them for months, I cannot remember seeing once a falmer child. I am now convinced that this is proof of a symbiotic relationship with the chaurus. I propose the falmer are, in fact, rectruiting females for the chauri to reproduce with. For what reason however, I cannot tell. I will have to return to Blackreach and study them further.


    Other species seem to have developed opportunistic relationship with the chauri.


    Their purple bodies are sometimes crawling with worms, eager to insert themselves in their reproductive organs. Human and mer females are expect to be easily infected by these worms. Since they are too large to fit in the orifice of their victim, these worms will instead protude obscenely from the anal or vaginal opening of their victims. Besides the lubrication and arousal they produce, they are quite harmless and will often leave their host body on their own.


    Given the bioluminescent fluid the worms release, I believe they are the source of the glowing goo chauri use to form egg sacs, as well as the ointment falmer shamans brew to improve the fertility of their female captives. 


    Chaurus egg sacs also seem to attract undergroup creatures such as Estrust Tentacles. This tentacular creature lays in wait for a chaurus to come and tend to its eggs before attacking it. The tentacles are equipped with suction cups and probes used to feed from their victims. In rare cases where the victim was human an mer, two possible outcomes have been observed. The attack can accidentally infect the victim with chaurus eggs from the nearby egg sacs. In rare situations, the creature itself remains attached to the victim, with tentacles wrapped around her body for long term sustenance. The poor females are then doomed to live with their parasites, as any attempt to remove them forcibly results in painful agony and death.


    In alchemic terms, one should be sure to improve one's resistance to poison with potions or enchantments when facing the chauri, for they project a stream of poison that drains health for five seconds. Using sharp pincers, the chaurus will repeatedly poison and slash its prey. In groups, the multiple poison attacks stack and can drain health in seconds.


    Mixed with ground Death Bells petals and a dash of frostbite spider poison, ground up chaurus chitin can produce a poweful potion that will pacify any chaurus for a short period of time.


    Pods in a chaurus nest may be harvested for Chaurus Eggs, an ingredient used in Alchemy. A dead chaurus may provide Chaurus Chitin, a material used to improve Falmer weapons and armor, and occasionally a few chaurus eggs. Though chaurus chitin may be used to improve Falmer armor, one cannot create any. 


    In some places inhabited by Falmer, one will sometimes find the carcasses of giant chaurus used for the supports of a Falmer tent.

    The Falmer helmet, shield, and bow have little green dots decorating them, though the chaurus themselves lack these dots. They still seem to have small blue dots, which may turn green after their death.


    Finally, I even came across a chaurus pie recipe, although there was no indicate as to the nurtitional value of such a meal.

    If you go hunting for chaurus meat to make some dinner with, make sure you don't end up as dinner yourself.
